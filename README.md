# Wedding App

This application is was a simple request from a couple that wanted a wedding app with some basic features. The full documentation for this application is in the `docs` directory. The documentation **is not** hosted anywhere. To see the docs, got to the `docs` directory and run:

```
npm i -g docsify-cli
docsify serve
```
